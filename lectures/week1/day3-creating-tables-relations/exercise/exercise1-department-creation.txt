1) Reset your staff table by rerunning the staff.sql file.
2) Create a table called departments. The table should have the following columns:

		id - mediumint(8) primary key autoincrement.
		dept_name - varchar of suitable length. It should also be a required and unique. It will store the departments name.
		boss_id - mediumint(8). This field will save a foreign key to the boss of the department.

3) Use select statements on the staff table to find the ids of the following individuals and make a note of their ids.

	Dane Gray who will be incharge of accounts
	Nina Lang who will be incharge of marketing
	Daquan Flynn who will be incharge of business development
	Joseph Barron who will be incharge of research
	Dustin Perez who will be incharge of software development


4) Now populate the departments table. (hint department names are listed above, and you have just found the id to the bosses of each department).
4b) Add a another department called "New department" we don't know who will be boss so leave that column blank.

5) Alter the staff table adding a new mediumint(8) column called department_id. 


6) 	Now we need to add staff to the departments.
6a) Manually update our bosses in the staff table and set the department_id column to their departments.
6b) Put a few more staff into departments each department, with the exception of the "New department".
